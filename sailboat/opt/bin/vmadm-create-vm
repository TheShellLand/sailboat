# SmartOS script creating VMs
#
# Provides an easy to use script for creating LX, Joyent, and KVM zones
# This de-encumbers the use of manual typing and creates the json vm spec automatically
# Also, I stopped wanting to refer to an endless number of json files for figuring out what options to use for which
#  type of VM I was creating
