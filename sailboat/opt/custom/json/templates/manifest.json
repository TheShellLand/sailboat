When creating your own manifest, the following properties are required:

    uuid: The UUID of the image (use an online UUID generator)
    name: The name of the image (eg: "centos-6")
    version: The version of the image (eg: "1.0.0")
    description: A short description of the image
    published_at: A timestamp for the date of publication on an image server (this does not need to be accurate); to output the current time in the proper format use the command: date +"%Y-%m-%dT%T.000Z"
    creator_uuid: The UUID of the author of the image (use an online UUID generator if you don't have one)
    creator_name: The name of the image author
    urn: A special string for describing the image in the form "cloud_name:creator_name:name:version"; for the "cloud_name" I suggest "smartos" if you are unsure, the creator name is usually your organization. The string should not contain spaces. (eg: "smartos:cuddletech:plan9:1.0.0")
    type: The type of image, either "zvol" for KVM or "zone-dataset" for Zones
    os: The OS of this image (this is required, but not validated or used, so use whatever you like)
    files: An array of one or more file objects, containing the following properties for each:
        path: Local file path to the image data file (compressed zfs dump)
        sha1: The SHA1 for the image data file; to obtain the SHA1 hash use: digest -a sha1 <file>
        size: The file size of the image data file; to obtain use: ls -l <file>
